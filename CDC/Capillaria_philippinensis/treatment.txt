The medications used to treat C. hepatica include thiabendazole and albendazole. However, C. hepatica is a rare infection and clinical experience is limited. Steroids have been used to help control the inflammation of the liver.
 
To treat C. philippinensis, medications that can be used include mebendazole (200 mg twice a day for 20 days), and albendazole (400 mg a day for 10 days).
 
(Note: Albendazole must be taken with food; a fatty meal increases oral bioavailability.)
