Anthelmintic medications (drugs that remove parasitic worms from the body), such as albendazole and mebendazole, are the drugs of choice for treatment of Ascaris infections, regardless of the species of worm. Infections are generally treated for 1â€“3 days. The drugs are effective and appear to have few side effects.
 
(Note: Albendazole should be taken with food. Ivermectin should be taken on an empty stomach with water.)
