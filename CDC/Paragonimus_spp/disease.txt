Infection with Paragonimus spp. can result in an acute syndrome with cough, abdominal pain, discomfort, and low-grade fever that may occur 2 to 15 days after infection. Persons with light infections may have no symptoms. Symptoms of long-term infection may mimic bronchitis or tuberculosis, with coughing up of blood-tinged sputum.
