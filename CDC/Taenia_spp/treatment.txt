Treatment is available after accurate diagnosis. Your doctor will provide prescription medication, which is taken by mouth. Work with your health care provider for proper treatment options for you and your family.
 
(Note: Both praziquantel and albendazole should be used cautiously in patients suspected to have cysticercosis.  There are case reports of seizures that may have been temporally associated with treatment.)
